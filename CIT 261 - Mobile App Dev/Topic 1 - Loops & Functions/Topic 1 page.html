		<h1>Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Arrays</h1>
		<p>Here is my teaching session: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W3VGzqhTZo&feature=youtu.be">Loops, Functions, etc...</a></p>

		<h4>Topic 1 was all about Loops, conditional statements, functions, and arrays. The 3 code blocks below use a combination of these to perform their actions. They are simple but show the basic concepts and applications. </h4>

		<div id="Counter" class="testingBlock">
			<p>This first code block illistrates the use of a for loop. The function counts by 3s until the number is greater the 9.</p>
			<button type="button" onclick="count()">Count</button>
			<div id="counterOutput"></div>
		</div><br>
		

		<div id="Evens_In_Array" class="testingBlock">
			<p>In this example we have an array that is full of random numbers. The array also contains positive and negative numbers. When you clikc the button we use a for loop to go throught the array. Inside of the for loop we have an if statement to check each number to see if it is even. The output will give you a list of the even numbers in the array.</p>
			<button type="button" onclick="countEvens()">Evens in Array</button><br>
			All even numbers in the array:<div id="evensDiv"></div>
		</div><br>

		<div id="Credit_Year" class="testingBlock">
			<p>Here we will look at Conditional Statements to determine what grade year you are based on the amount of credits you. </p>
			<p>Your Name:</p>
			<input type="text" id="studentsName">
			<p>Please enter the number of credits completed:</p>
			<input type="text" id="creditNumber">
			<button type="button" onclick="yearOfSchool()">School Year</button>
			<div id="messageOutput"></div>
		</div><br>
