	<h1 id="header">CSS3 Transitions</h1>

	<h4>In this topic we will look at Transitions. Transitions are great and smooth changes between different element states. Transitions have similar properties as animations and transforms. The duration property is the only required property that you need to specify. With out a duration, the transition will not occur.</h4>

	<h4>Here we have a div that will expand when you hover over it. This div does not have a transition so it will look very jumpy and does not look very good.</h4>
	<div id="blowUp2" class="testingBlock">
		<h4>Hover over me</h4>
		<p>This div does not have a transition</p>
	</div><br>


	<h4>Unlike the last example we have now added a transition. Take a look and see the difference. You can see that the change is smooth and doesnt jump out at you.</h4>
	<div id="blowUp" class="testingBlock">
		<h4>Hover over me</h4>
	</div><br>


	<h4>In this example we allow the Ying Yang symbol move around the page when you click. You can also use the arrow keys to move it. You will see the symbol fly across the screen instead of just appearing where you click.</h4>
	<div class="ballDiv">
		<p id="ballMover">Click anywhere to move the ball</p>
		<div id="ball">
			<img src="YingYangButton.png" style="display: block;margin:0px; padding: 0px;width:50px; height:50px; position: center">
		</div>
	</div>
