	<h1>HTML5 Tags - Video, Audio, and Canvas</h1>

	<h4>We are here to cover the Video, Audio, and Canvas tags. These tags are relatively new and came out with HTML 5.</h4>
	<p>Here is my teaching session: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZRP6ti8nN4&feature=youtu.be">HTML5 Tags</a></p>



	
	<div class="testingBlock">
		<h2>Video</h2>

		<p>Here is a video element. To play a vidoe before HTML5 you would have needed to use a plug-in like flash. Now it is built in. Enjoy the waterfall.</p>

		<video width="320" height="240" controls poster="waterdrop.png">
			<source src="343291949.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			The video tag is not supported in your browser.
		</video>
	</div><br>

	<div class="testingBlock">
		<h2>Audio</h2>

		<p>Here is a audio element. The audio is the new like the video tag, and now allows you to play audio with out needing a plug-in.Enjoy the drips.</p>

		<audio controls muted>
			<source src="Water Drop-SoundBible.com-2039669379.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
	</div><br>

	<div class="testingBlock">
		<h2>Canvas</h2>
		<p>The canvas is very powerful and allows you to draw graphics. Teh canvas below is a place holder. You use JavaScript to actual draw the elements on the canvas. I have added a few small graphics but there are many more things that you can do with the canvas.</p>
		<button type="button" onclick="drawLine()">Draw Line</button><button type="button" onclick="fill()">Fill</button><button type="button" onclick="circle()">Draw Circle</button><br>
		<canvas id="lineCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border: 1px solid #000000;"></canvas>
	</div><br>
