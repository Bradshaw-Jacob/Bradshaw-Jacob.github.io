	<h1>JSON Parsing & Stringify</h1>

	<h4>Topic 3 was all about parsing and stringifying data. Both are JSON methods that are used to convert data. They are opposites of each other. </h4>


	<div id="string" class="testingBlock">
		<p>The stringify method is first. Stringify is used when sending data to a web server. The data has to been a string. You can also use stringify if you would like to display a string value in the browser.</p>
		<p>In this example we will create a JSON object and store it in local storage to pretend that we sent it to a web server.</p>

		<button type="button" onclick="stringifyMe()">Stringify</button>
		<div id="confirm"></div>
	</div><br>

	<div id="parse" class="testingBlock">
		<p>We will now look at the parse method. If you were to receive data from a web server that data would come as a string. You would then use parse to convert that data into a JSON object. In Topic 4 you will see this in more action. For this example we have an object that we stored as a string. We will parse that object and return the values in that object.</p>
