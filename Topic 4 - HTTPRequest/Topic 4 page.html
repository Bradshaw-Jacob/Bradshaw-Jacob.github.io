	<h1>Using AJAX to Consume a JSON Web Service</h1>

	<h4>Topic 4 is all about making API calls using the AJAX httpRequest. You will see below that we make a call to Github.</h4>

	<div class="testingBlock">
		<p>Here is this example we are using the XML Http Request to pull the amount and name of all the repositoies that I have on my GitHub.</p><br>

		<button type="button" onclick="call()">How many repos?</button>

		<p>How many:</p>
		<div id="amount"></div>

		<p>Names:</p>
		<div id="repoNames"></div>
	</div><br>

	<div class="testingBlock">
